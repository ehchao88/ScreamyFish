##Our Inspiration:
We wanted to leverage modern technologies to create a simple and fun way to aid
in learning a new language. We found the Google Cloud Suite to be an efficient
way to incorporate such technologies into our final game. Using Google's highly
reliable pre-trained models, we were able to focus on the functionality of our
application and play around with exciting new tools without worrying about the
time consuming aspects of machine learning, being designing and training a model. Our goal was not to reinvent the wheel, but to find an interesting use cases
for these exciting innovations in the tech world, and Screamy Fish is just one
small example of a unique usage of them.
